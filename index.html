                <p class="awesome-text mini-text">Why, you might be asking. Why is this website awesome? What makes it so awesome? Well, dear citizen, the answer is simple: the chorse. Yes, that is right. The legendary creatures themselves, the c h o r s e. This website, being dedicated to the chorse is, therefore, inarguably, adamantly and OBJECTIVELY awesome*</p>
                <p class="awesome-text foot-note">*Otherwise can not be argued, because I invoke the right of the chorse given to me by Emperor Quil'thar his highness.</p>
